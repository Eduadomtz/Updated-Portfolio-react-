      <p>
        Welcome to my space! I love history and teaching. I have a degree in History. I won a international scholarship to study my master at Spain in Research on Teaching and Learning in the Social Sciences. I have taught at all educational levels. I have received awards as the best teacher in my school. I have an educational project on Youtube in which I talk about history. My channel is called "Crónivas en vilo" if you want to take a look at it. Nowadays I’m studying a Bootcamp to become a Full Stack Web Developer.
